# Nginx Load Balancing with Node.js Servers

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to set up Nginx as a load balancer for multiple Node.js servers. The setup includes installing Nginx, running a project on Nginx, and configuring Nginx to balance the load across multiple Node.js servers.

## Task Breakdown

1. **Install Nginx**

   Install the Nginx web server to handle HTTP requests and manage load balancing.

2. **Run a Project on Nginx**

   Configure Nginx to serve a specific project. This could be a static website, web application, or any other project that Nginx is capable of hosting.

3. **Create Multiple Node.js Servers**

   Set up and run multiple Node.js servers. These servers should be configured to handle incoming requests and perform the necessary backend operations for your application.

4. **Configure Nginx for Load Balancing**

   Configure Nginx to use load balancing to distribute incoming requests across the multiple Node.js servers. This involves setting up Nginx to act as a reverse proxy, directing traffic to the various Node.js servers based on load balancing algorithms such as round-robin.

## Summary

The setup involves using Nginx to serve a project and configure it as a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple Node.js servers. This configuration ensures that requests are efficiently managed and distributed, improving the scalability and reliability of the application.
